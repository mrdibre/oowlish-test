### Technical Debits

- Finish tests for usecases and infra layer
- Create tests for ui components
- Improve the logic on calculate the worked hours, because it's very easy broke the current logic.
- Do validations on log in


##### Disclaimer

My main goal here was the architecture of the project, and the organization of the code, so, for this
reason I might not have reached all the requirements of the test. I hope you enjoy it.
